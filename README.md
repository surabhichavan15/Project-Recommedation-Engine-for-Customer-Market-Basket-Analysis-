Project Recommendation Engine for Customer Market Basket Analysis

Overview
This project implements a recommendation engine for customer market basket analysis. It analyzes customer purchase history to identify frequently bought items and suggests related items that the customer may also be interested in purchasing. This recommendation engine is built using Python and uses the Apriori algorithm to perform market basket analysis.

Data Source
The data used in this project is the publicly available Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset. It contains anonymized transactional data of customers from a grocery store.

Technologies Used
Python
Scikit-learn
NumPy
Pandas
Apriori Algorithm

Steps Involved
1. Data Preparation:
Extracts and preprocesses the data from the Instacart dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis:
Performs exploratory data analysis to understand the patterns and trends in the data.

3. Market Basket Analysis:
Uses the Apriori algorithm to perform market basket analysis on the customer purchase history data.

4. Recommendation Engine:
Builds a recommendation engine to suggest related items to the customer based on their purchase history.

5. Evaluation:
Evaluates the performance of the recommendation engine using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.

6. Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to build a recommendation engine for customer market basket analysis using Python and the Apriori algorithm. By following the steps outlined in this project, one can gain valuable insights into customer purchase patterns and develop a recommendation system to improve sales and customer satisfaction. The project is publicly available on GitHub, allowing anyone to access and use the code to implement their own recommendation engine.
